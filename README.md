This repo consists of an old retro game named Pong which is actually very fun to play 

While developing this game I learned a lot new things about 2d game concepts, overall it was very fun experince.

If you wanna try this game Download the source files and run the main.lua file.
Also make sure you have Love2d and Lua insatlled in order to run this.
